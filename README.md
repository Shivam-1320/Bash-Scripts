**⚠ Disclaimer**

Please do not blindly trust or run these scripts in production environments.

I frequently update and revise these scripts — mistakes are possible, and things may break.
Always review and test scripts in a safe environment before using them on real systems.

Linux system (Ubuntu, Debian, Kali, etc.)
