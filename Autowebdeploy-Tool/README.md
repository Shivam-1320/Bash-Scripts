Author: Pankaj Baghel (GitHub: shivam-1320)


**AutoWebDeploy** is a beginner-friendly Bash script that automates the deployment of web applications from a GitHub repository to a Linux server using Apache or NGINX.

It’s designed for personal projects, testing environments, or learning automation using Bash.  
You just provide your repo — it does the rest.

##  Features

- Clone a GitHub repository to a target web directory
- Automatically install Apache or NGINX (user choice)
- Clean and update target directory before deployment
- Set permissions correctly for web server usage
- Restart the web server after deployment
- Color-coded CLI for better user interaction

I frequently update and revise these scripts — mistakes are possible, and things may break.
Always review and test scripts in a safe environment before using them on real systems.
