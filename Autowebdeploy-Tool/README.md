# AutoWebDeploy

**AutoWebDeploy** is a beginner-friendly Bash script that automates the deployment of web applications from a GitHub repository to a Linux server using Apache or NGINX.

It’s designed for personal projects, testing environments, or learning automation using Bash.  
You just provide your repo — it does the rest.

##  Features

- Clone a GitHub repository to a target web directory
- Automatically install Apache or NGINX (user choice)
- Clean and update target directory before deployment
- Set permissions correctly for web server usage
- Restart the web server after deployment
- Color-coded CLI for better user interaction

##  Getting Started

**⚠ Disclaimer**

Please do not blindly trust or run these scripts in production environments.
I’m a beginner still learning Bash scripting, and this repository is a work in progress.
I frequently update and revise these scripts — mistakes are possible, and things may break.
Always review and test scripts in a safe environment before using them on real systems.



 
**Requirements**

Linux system (Ubuntu, Debian, Kali, etc.)

bash shell

Root privileges (for most scripts)
